## Bio <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="30px" />
👩🏿‍💻 An ambitious and determined individual who took a leap of faith in 2021 by changing my career path. Despite having no prior experience in my chosen field, I didn't let that stop me from embracing the challenge. 💪🏿

🎓 To develop my skills, I enrolled in the 'Introduction to Web Development' Course with Code First Girls, where I collaborated with a team of four to create a captivating travel blog. 🌍

💻 Building on that experience, I then applied for a 30-week Full-stack development bootcamp offered by CBF & Niyo Group. Throughout the program, I worked on various projects, utilizing different programming languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js on the server-side, and REACT on the front end, along with MongoDB databases. 🚀

🔑 Furthering my knowledge, I successfully completed my AWS Cloud Practitioner certification, gaining a deep understanding of various AWS Services, database DynamoDB, and Python code. 🌩️

⏳ During my free time, I have a keen interest in investing 💰, exploring different countries 🌎, making new friends along the way, diving into astrology ♋, and working on innovative technologies and products that can enhance our lives and contribute to the health of our planet. 🌱

My journey is a testament to my unwavering determination, adaptability, and thirst for knowledge. I embrace challenges head-on and strive for personal growth while aiming to make a meaningful impact through technology. ✨ <img src="https://media4.giphy.com/media/UOdoMz3baCENO/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e47cyqy7oztmuuv0w3trvyeyfbh04d8plo9wywcffw4&rid=giphy.gif&ct=g" width="30"/></li>.
